Build Road

You have to reach from one castle, castle A, to another, castle B. But there is a forest in between castle A and castle B. The forest consists of cells. Each cell will either be an empty area represented by a 0 or will be occupied by a tree represented by a 1. You can walk through an empty cell but not through a tree. You can move to any adjacent cell, but not outside the forest. Adjacent cells include all the 8 neighbors of a cell. (This number might be lesser for cells at the edges and corners). You can reach CASTLE B if a consistent trail of empty area is made from CASTLE A to CASTLE B without being blocked by trees. What is the count of minimum number of trees which you need to cut in the forest to reach castle B from castle A?

See this diagram below for furthur clarification.

CASTLE A  
1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 <- you can start anywhere in this row  
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1   
1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 <- you can end anywhere in this row  
CASTLE B  
Input Format
The first line contains a number T which shows the number of test cases. Each test caseâ€™s first line will contain two numbers x and y separated by space, the number of rows and columns in the forest. Each test case will have x rows consisting of y columns each separated by spaces. The values in the forest will be 0 representing empty area and 1 representing column.

Output Format
Output T lines containing the minimum number of trees you need to cut for each test case.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 20
1 <= N,M <= 20

Sample Input:

Explanation

For the first case, a possible solution is:

0 1 1 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0
1 1 1 C 1 1 1
1 1 1 C 1 1 1
1 1 1 C 1 1 1
C represent the trees to be cut which is 3 in count

2 2
1 1
1 1 Here you need to cut atleast 2 trees to make a road.
